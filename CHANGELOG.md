## Phase 0 — bring-up complete (2026-05-11)

Phase 0 closes with all 9 spec invariants proven at the Rust layer and the
real-LLM ship gate (§ 11.9) self-implemented end-to-end against a real
`claude` CLI. Phase 1 begins with the Phase 2 backlog from
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-real-llm-e2e-design.md`.

### What ships in Phase 0

- **World server** (`crates/world/`): SQLite-backed mpsc-routed loop with
  16 MCP tools, axum HTTP + WS surface, room A\* pathfinding, task
  scheduler, budget ladder (warn/95/pause), agent supervisor, sandbox
  path resolver.
- **Worker** (`packages/worker/`): WS client, MCP correlation, mock and
  real-LLM run modes, supervisor-respawn semantics.
- **Adapters** (`packages/adapters/{claude-code,codex,opencode}/`): unified
  `BackendAdapter` contract with hook bridge, MCP-at-the-world HTTP wiring,
  contract-tested cross-adapter.
- **Frontend** (`packages/frontend/`): React + Pixi 2D console, kanban,
  chat panel, possess transition, system event feed, 14 Playwright tests.

### Test counts at seal

| Layer | Tests |
|---|---|
| `cargo test -p cliptown-world` | 213 |
| `pnpm -F @cliptown/worker test` | 62 |
| `pnpm -F @cliptown/adapter-{core,claude-code,codex,opencode} test` | 12 |
| `pnpm -F @cliptown/frontend test` (Playwright) | 14 |

### M9.10 — real-LLM E2E (§ 11.9)

The longest milestone of Phase 0. Closed in 9 PRs across two arcs:

**Architecture (one merge train, #19 → #25):**
- `A1'` MCP-over-HTTP at the world (route + 16-tool catalog + bearer auth)
- `A2` worker `--real` flag spawns the adapter against world MCP
- `A3` `scripts/smoke-real-llm.sh` runs the chain locally with colored output
- `B` `pnpm -F @cliptown/e2e-real-llm start` runs it with structured JSON
- `C` was shipped then reverted in #25 — cliptown is open source and we
  don't want fork contributors to need an Anthropic API key in CI secrets

**Hardening (#26 → #29):**
- `#26` First real run surfaced three smoke-execution bugs (pnpm
  workspace discovery, script arg re-shelling, world's per-agent random
  secret unreachable from out-of-band workers). All fixed; smoke passes
  green against `claude` 2.1.138 OAuth, haiku-shaped output at canonical
  `workspaces/<sid>/artifacts/<tid>.md` path, task state machine
  transitions to `awaiting_review`.
- `#27` Ship-gate § 11.9 cell lifts from "real-LLM only — M9.10"
  placeholder to a runner pointer + verified-pass timestamp.
- `#28` `CLIPTOWN_TEST_DISABLE_SUPERVISOR=1` silences nine
  `spawn_agent failed` warnings per smoke run.
- `#29` Budget telemetry: `claude --output-format json` lets the adapter
  scrape `total_cost_usd`; worker forwards as `report_budget` WS frame;
  world's `apply_report` uses CLI cost when present, falls back to the
  pricing table otherwise. Smoke output now shows
  `budget_spent_usd ≈ $0.31` instead of `$0` — the cap (default $0.50)
  has real teeth.

### Phase 0 hardening (TODOS.md → Completed)

- **P3 emit_system_event JSON fallback**: malformed payloads now broadcast
  the raw string instead of silently degrading to `Value::Null`, so the
  audit log and operator console stay in sync. Loud-fail with
  `tracing::error!`.

### M10.1 — performance regression gate

- `cargo bench -p cliptown-world` runs two criterion benches (placeholder
  tick latency + mpsc throughput) and writes JSON estimates to
  `target/criterion/`.
- `bench/check.mjs` reads criterion's medians, converts to baseline units,
  and fails (exit 1) if any metric regresses by more than `tolerance_pct`
  (20% default).
- `.github/workflows/bench.yml` runs the gate on every PR. Phase 0 ships
  the gate as `continue-on-error: true` while the CI baselines stabilize
  vs developer hardware; flip to a hard gate after a few CI samples.

### Known limitations carried into Phase 1

- `codex` and `opencode` adapters share the MCP HTTP contract but their
  worker `--real` path throws `not_yet_supported_in_real_mode`. § 11.9
  is verified with `claude_code` only; each follow-on adapter gets its
  own A2-equivalent prompt/CLI wiring as a Phase 1 task.
- `total_cost_usd` is only scraped from `claude-code` today. `codex` and
  `opencode` adapters return `usage: undefined` and the world falls back
  to the pricing table for those models.
- Two criterion benches are still placeholders (sum 0..1000 for "tick
  latency", in-process 1k-msg mpsc for "throughput"). Phase 1 swaps in
  real `loop_::spawn`-driven harnesses.
- Frontend FCP bench (`packages/frontend/bench/fcp.spec.ts`) is
  `test.describe.skip`; CI gate covers it via the ceiling-only check
  once the Playwright run includes it.

### Phase 2 backlog (from M9.10 spec)

Three patterns imported from multica that didn't block § 11.9:

- **P2.1 — Daemon health buckets**: 4-state worker liveness
  (online/recently_lost/offline/about_to_gc) so transient network blips
  don't surface to the operator console as crashes. ~2-3h.
- **P2.2 — Skills system**: reusable per-task capabilities stored as
  markdown + files, attached to agents, written into the per-task
  workdir at spawn. ~1-2 weeks. Depends on P2.3.
- **P2.3 — Per-task execenv directories**: `{workspaces}/{sid}/{tid}/`
  with workdir + injected CLAUDE.md + skill files + 7-day GC. ~3-5 days.
  Prerequisite for P2.2.
